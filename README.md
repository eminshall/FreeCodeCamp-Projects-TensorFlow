# FreeCodeCamp-Projects-TensorFlow

A repository to hold the projects associated with FreeCode Camp's course on Machine Learning in TensorFlow.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/

Much of the code was provided by FreeCode Camp and I  was tasked to finish the code to accomplish the goal.

Projects include:
* Book Recommendation with KNN
* Cat and Dog image classification
* Predicting Healthcare costs with Regression
* SMS Text Classification

These projects were challenging and I relied on my peers for help.
